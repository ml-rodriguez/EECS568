To get up and running with the kinect, you'll have to leap through some hoops.

My guide will assume your working in Ubuntu since it's what you have on hand,
but I'm sure you can tweak it to get this running in any form of Linux.

First, you'll want a copy of libfreenect, an open Kinect library
(www.openkinect.org). To short circuit your efforts to go through their guides,
I will take this liberty of telling you how to build it on your own. Run the below
commands. I did this from my home directory.

sudo apt-get install git-core cmake libglut3-dev pkg-config build-essential libxmu-dev libxi-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev
git clone git://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect.git
cd libfreenect
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig /usr/local/lib64/

Note: your first line may look like this depending on your version of Ubuntu:
sudo apt-get install git-core cmake freeglut3-dev pkg-config build-essential libxmu-dev libxi-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev

You're not going to be able to run your kinect unless you have root priveleges, but
this is a pain in the ass. We'll add some udev rules to fix this. You're going to add
yourself to a group called "video" and make some rules about using the kinect that
apply to people in the video group. Run the "setup-rules.sh" script included in the
same directory as this README as root and everything should ge set up for you:

sudo ./setup-rules.sh <your-username>

At this point you may need to log out and log back in real fast.

Now, going back to libfreenect! Plug in your Kinect (power and USB) and see if we can
get some data. libfreenect includes some demos:

cd ~/libfreenect/build/bin
./glview

If this works, then you should see an RGB visualization of depth as well as the actual
RGB image being returned by the kinect pop up on your screen. You can twiddle with some
keys to move the kinect around and to change the camera you're viewing images from.
Neat!

UPDATED DEPENDENCIES NOTES:
I just added the jar files for the dependencies. This is just easier. If we need more things,
I'll build new jars and update them. Simple. The jars are in the rgbd-slam folder. Add to
your .bashrc:

export CLASSPATH=$HOME/<path-to-rgbd-slam-folder>/lcm.jar:$HOME/<path-to-rgb-slam-folder>/april.jar

Then reload your terminal or manually reload the .bashrc with:

source ~/.bashrc

Now, returning the home of this README, enter the kinect java directory. Try building. If
this doesn't work, you need to bug Rob. It should. He'll help you fix it and update this
README. :)

mkdir lib
cd java
mkdir build
ant

We just need to tack a couple more locations into our .bashrc file:

export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:$HOME/<path-to-kinect-folder>/java/kinect.jar
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/libfreenect/build/lib:$HOME/<path-to-kinect-folder>/lib:$HOME/<path-to-rgbd-slam-folder>/lib

And again, reload the file:

source ~/.bashrc

What we've done is point java to our new kinect files with the CLASSPATH changes and
made them available for use in other projects (as well as conveniently runnable from
anywhere!) The LD_LIBRARY_PATH changes point us at the libfreenect libraries (which
actually shouldn't be necessary, but are nice to know about) and, more importantly,
our library for the kinect JNI bindings that are allowing the C-based libfreenect
library to chat with our java code. If we don't know where that library file is,
none of this will work. Now that we theoretically should be done, though, try running

java kinect.KinectDemo

If all is going according to plan, you should see my version of libfreenect's glview
program. It doesn't let you change cameras or anything, but it spits out frames at
30 fps, so hot damn! That's pretty exciting. Congratulations, now you can start using
a kinect in other java projects. For usage, see the source for the demo.
