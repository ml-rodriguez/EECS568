1) To run a suite of test cases on our MultiGaussian implementation, also bringing up
a GUI to generate random samples to verify our implementation of contour, run:

java -cp april.jar team.MultiGaussian

2) To run a GUI for generating random samples and tweaking noise parameters for problem 4,
run:

java -cp april.jar team.GaussianFit

Controls are intuitive, but just in case, the mean and linearization values are hardcoded,
but variance parameters are tuneable at the bottom of the GUI and samples are generated by
clicking the button.
